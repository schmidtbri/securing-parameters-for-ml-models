    "Summary: In the Python ecosystem, using pickle to serialize machine learning models is very common. Pickle is a built-in Python library module that makes it easy to convert in-memory objects into bytestreams that can be saved to a hard drive or sent over networks. Pickling an object is very quick and simple and is the easiest way to persist a complex Python object for later use. However, pickle is not a secure serialization standard. The documentation for the pickle module in the Python standard library explicitly mentions the insecure nature of the pickle format: Warning The pickle module is not secure. Only unpickle data you trust. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never unpickle data that could have come from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with. In this blog post, we'll be downloading a dataset, exploring it, training a model, signing the model parameters, and deploying the model parameters and model to a Kubernetes cluster as a RESTful service. We'll also be loading the model parameters from a network storage service to show how to secure the model parameters while they are stored separately from the model deployment."

    "What can we do about this? Pickling is the easiest way to save model objectsand using pickle for model serialization is ubiquitous in Data Science. One thing that we can do is make sure that the pickle files that hold our models are not modified in the time between the training process and the prediction process. This way, we can be sure that the contents of the file are benign. This is especially important in models that are deployed in production services that are running in sensitive environments. If we allow the model service that is hosting the model to load a pickle file that has been compromised, we can allow arbritrary code execution on the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to prevent the pickle file from being modified is by \"signing\" it. Signing a file means processing the data and creating a \"signature\" that we can use later to make sure that the contents of the file have not been changed since it was signed. In order to still be able to use pickle in a production setting, we'll require that the model parameters be signed right after they are created, then we'll check the signature before we load the parameters within the model service. If the signature does not match, we'll know that the model parameters are not safe to load. However, signing model parameters does not encrypt them, so it is still possible for someone with access to the pickle files to view the model parameters.\n",

    "In this blog post we trained, validated, signed, and verified a set of model parameters to ensure that they remain secure. This process is needed because of the inherent security problems that Python pickles bring with them. The signing and verificationprocess added a little bit of complexity, but it's worth it to ensure the security of the model deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also showed how to deploy the serialized model parameters to a storage service, and how to access them from the deployed model. We did this to show a common vulnerability of machine learning model deployments. Since a lot of model parameters are not deployed alongside the prediction code, they are deployed in a separate storage service from which they are loaded. This practice makes the deployment of model parameters faster, but adds another attack vector that needs to be secured. Since the model parameters are stored in a storage server, an attacker can access the storage service and modify the model parameters in order to do arbritrary code execution in the server where the model is deployed. By adding a signature verification process before the model parameters can be deserialized, we made the deployment of model parameters a little more secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve this process is to make it into a plug-in that can be easily added to model training and prediction code, making it simpler to add to a training pipeline and model deployment. Another way to improve it is by adding a key cycling mechanism to ensure that secret keys do not remain in production for a long time."
